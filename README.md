# TextCraft

Overview

This project will be a text based game where you will need to find certain items to interact and collect the final items. 

Inspiration

I remember playing oregon trail and other mostly text based games growing up. Just looking to create a new adventure that I would be able to grow as I become more skilled with python and other coding languages. 

# Skills Used

# In order to accomplish this project, I had to use the following pythonic skills:

# for loops
# functions
# if/elif/else logic
# etc...
